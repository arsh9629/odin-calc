# odin-calc

This is Odin's last project in Foundation course
I finished it at 11/09/2022

It's a most underwhelming project i've ever done. Because after just saw the name of the project without even peek into what they actually expect. I did calculator Project with eval() and did some workout. and got a big suprise after finishing the project that odin demanded to do this without eval...I almost lost motivation still i managed to so something..

How to Handle this Calc.
*Numbers will erase after pressing operator. (ex. 55 after + 55 will erase on the screen but actually there. )
*Should input another operator after equals to continue to get move output (ex.5+4=9+1=10-3=7)

My Original Calculator which i actually do in intrest, is on https://github.com/arsh9629/my_calc
